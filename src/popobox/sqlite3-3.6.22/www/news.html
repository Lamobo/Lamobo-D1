<h2>Recent News</h2>

<a name="2010_jan_06"></a><h3>2010-Jan-06 - <a href="releaselog/3_6_22.html">Version 3.6.22</a></h3><p>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_22.html">version 3.6.22</a> is a bug-fix release.  Two bugs have been fixed
  that might cause incorrect query results.  
  <ul>
  <li>Ticket <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/31338dca7e">31338dca7e</a>
  describes a
  problem with queries that have a WHERE clause of the form (x AND y) OR z
  where x and z come from one table of a join and y comes from a different
  table.
  <li> Ticket <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/eb5548a849">eb5548a849</a>
  describes
  a problem where the use of the CAST operator in the WHERE clause can lead
  to incorrect results if the column being cast to a new datatype is also
  used in the same WHERE clause without being cast.
  </ul>
  Both bugs are obscure,
  but because they could arise in an application after deployment, it is
  recommended that all applications upgrade SQLite to version 3.6.22.</p>

<p>  This release also includes other minor bug fixes and performance
  enhancements, especially in the <a href="fts3.html">FTS3</a> extension.
</p><hr width="50%"><a name="2009_dec_07"></a><h3>2009-Dec-07 - <a href="releaselog/3_6_21.html">Version 3.6.21</a></h3><p>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_21.html">version 3.6.21</a> focuses on performance optimization.  For
  a certain set of traces, this version uses 12% fewer CPU instructions
  than the previous release (as measured by valgrind).  In addition, the
  <a href="fts3.html">FTS3</a> extension has been through an extensive cleanup and rework and
  the <a href="c3ref/profile.html">sqlite3_trace()</a> interface has been modified to insert 
  <a href="lang_expr.html#varparam">bound parameter</a> values into its output.
</p><hr width="50%"><a name="2009_nov_04"></a><h3>2009-Nov-04 - <a href="releaselog/3_6_20.html">Version 3.6.20</a></h3><p>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_20.html">version 3.6.20</a> is a general maintenance release.  The
  query planner has been enhanced to work better with bound parameters
  in LIKE and GLOB operators and in range constraints and various minor
  bugs have been fixed.  Upgrading from 3.6.19 is optional.
</p><hr width="50%"><a name="2009_oct_14"></a><h3>2009-Oct-14 - <a href="releaselog/3_6_19.html">Version 3.6.19</a></h3><p>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_19.html">version 3.6.19</a> adds native support for
  <a href="foreignkeys.html">foreign key constraints</a>, including deferred constraints and
  cascading deletes.  Enforcement of foreign keys is disabled by
  default for backwards compatibility and must be turned on using
  the <a href="pragma.html#pragma_foreign_keys">foreign_keys pragma</a>.</p>

<p>  Version 3.6.19 also adds support for the
  <a href="lang_expr.html#isisnot">IS and IS NOT operators</a>.  Formerly, SQLite (as most
  other SQL database engines) supported IS NULL and IS NOT NULL.  The
  IS and IS NOT operators are generalizations that allow the right-hand
  side to be an arbitrary expression.  IS and IS NOT work the same as
  == (equals) and != (not equals) except that with IS and IS NOT the
  NULL values compare equal to one another.
</p><hr width="50%"><a name="2009_sep_11"></a><h3>2009-Sep-11 - <a href="releaselog/3_6_18.html">Version 3.6.18</a></h3><p>
  Beginning with this release, the SQLite source code is tracked and
  managed using the <a href="http://www.fossil-scm.org/">Fossil</a>
  distributed configuration management system.  SQLite was previously
  versioned using CVS.  The entire CVS history has been imported into
  Fossil.  The older CVS repository remains on the website but is not
  read-only.</p>

<p>  There are two major enhancements in SQLite version 3.6.18.  The first
  is a series or refinements to the query planner that help SQLite to
  choose better plans for joins where in the past it was selecting suboptimal
  query plans.  The <a href="compile.html#enable_stat2">SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT2</a> compile-time option has been
  added to cause SQLite to collect histogram data on indices when the
  <a href="lang_analyze.html">ANALYZE</a> command is run.  The use of histograms improve the query
  planning performance even more.</p>

<p>  The second major enhancement is that SQLite now support recursive
  triggers.  The older non-recursive behavior of triggers is still the
  default behavior.  Recursive triggers are activated using the
  <a href="pragma.html#pragma_recursive_triggers">recursive_triggers pragma</a>.  In addition to allowing triggers to
  call themselves (either directly or indirectly) the new capability
  also fires DELETE triggers on rows that are removed from a table
  as a result of <a href="lang_conflict.html">REPLACE</a> conflict resolution processing.</p>

<p>  Non-recursive triggers are still the default behavior since this
  is least likely to cause problems for existing applications.  However,
  we anticipate that triggers will become
  recursive by default beginning with release 3.7.0.  At that point,
  applications that want to continue using the older non-recursive
  trigger behavior will need to use the <a href="pragma.html#pragma_recursive_triggers">recursive_triggers pragma</a>
  to disable recursive triggers.</p>

<p>  This version of SQLite also contains bug fixes, though none of the
  bugs are serious and all are obscure, so upgrading is optional.</p>

<p>  The SQLite core continues to have <a href="testing.html#coverage">100% branch test coverage</a>
  and so despite the many changes in this release, the developers 
  believe that this version of SQLite is stable and ready for production
  use.
</p><hr width="50%"><a name="2009_aug_10"></a><h3>2009-Aug-10 - <a href="releaselog/3_6_17.html">Version 3.6.17</a></h3><p>
  This is a monthly maintenance release with a focus of bug fixes,
  performance improvements, and increased test coverage.  This is the
  first release of SQLite since <a href="testing.html#coverage">100% branch test coverage</a>
  was achieved on the SQLite core.  </p>

<p>  In addition, a new interface <a href="c3ref/strnicmp.html">sqlite3_strnicmp()</a> is provided for the
  convenience of extension writers.</p>

<p>  None of the bugs fixed in this release are serious.  All bugs are
  obscure.  Upgrading is optional.
</p><hr width="50%"><a name="2009_july_25"></a><h3>2009-July-25 - 100% Branch Test Coverage</h3><p>
  A subset of the <a href="th3.html">TH3</a> test suite was measured by gcov to provide
  <a href="testing.html#coverage">100% branch test coverage</a> over the SQLite core
  (exclusive of the VFS backend and of extensions such as FTS3 and RTREE)
  when compiled for SuSE 10.1 Linux on x86.  The SQLite developers pledge
  to maintain branch test coverage at 100% in all future releases.
  Ongoing work will strive for 100% branch test coverage on the 
  operating-system backends and extensions as well.
</p><hr width="50%"><a name="2009_jun_27"></a><h3>2009-Jun-27 - <a href="releaselog/3_6_16.html">Version 3.6.16</a></h3><p>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_16.html">version 3.6.16</a> is another general maintenance relase containing
  performance and robustness enhancements.  A single notable bug was fixed
  (<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=3929">ticket #3929</a>).  This bug cause cause INSERT or UPDATE statements to fail
  on indexed tables that have AFTER triggers that modify the same table and
  index.
</p><hr width="50%"><a name="2009_jun_15"></a><h3>2009-Jun-15 - <a href="releaselog/3_6_15.html">Version 3.6.15</a></h3><p>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_15.html">version 3.6.15</a> is a general maintenance release containing
  performance and robustness enhancements and fixes for various obscure
  bugs.  
</p><hr width="50%"><a name="2009_may_25"></a><h3>2009-May-25 - <a href="releaselog/3_6_14_2.html">Version 3.6.14.2</a></h3><p>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_14_2.html">version 3.6.14.2</a> fixes an obscure bug in the code generator
  (<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=3879"><a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=3879">ticket #3879</a></a>)
  section of SQLite which can potentially cause incorrect query results.
  The changes from the prior release consist of only this one bug fix,
  check-in <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/chngview?cn=6676">[6676]</a>
  and a change to the version number text.</p>

<p>  The bug was introduced in version 3.6.14.  It is recommended that
  users of version 3.6.14 and 3.6.14.1 upgrade to this release.  Applications
  are unlikely to hit this bug, but since it is difficult to predict which
  applications might hit it and which might not, we recommend that all
  users of 3.6.14 and 3.5.14.1 upgrade to this release.
</p><hr width="50%"><a name="2009_may_19"></a><h3>2009-May-19 - <a href="releaselog/3_6_14_1.html">Version 3.6.14.1</a></h3><p>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_14_1.html">version 3.6.14.1</a> is a patch release to <a href="releaselog/3_6_14.html">version 3.6.14</a> with
  minimal changes that fixes three bugs.  Upgrading is only necessary 
  for users who are impacted by one or more of those bugs.
</p><hr width="50%"><a name="2009_may_07"></a><h3>2009-May-07 - <a href="releaselog/3_6_14.html">Version 3.6.14</a></h3><p>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_14.html">version 3.6.14</a> provides new performance enhancements in
  the btree and pager layers and in the query optimizer.  Certain
  workloads can be as much as twice as fast as the previous release,
  though 10% faster is a more typical result.</p>

<p>  Queries against <a href="vtab.html">virtual tables</a> that contain OR and IN operators
  in the WHERE clause are now able to use indexing.</p>

<p>  A new optional <a href="asyncvfs.html">asynchronous I/O backend</a> is available for
  unix and windows.  The asynchronous backend gives the illusion of faster
  response time by pushing slow write operations into a background thread.
  The tradeoff for faster response time is that more memory is required
  (to hold the content of the pending writes) and if a power failure or
  program crash occurs, some transactions that appeared to have committed
  might end up being rolled back upon restart.</p>

<p>  This release also contains many minor bug fixes, documentation enhancements,
  new test cases, and cleanups and simplifications to the source code.</p>

<p>  There is no compelling reason to upgrade from versions 3.6.12 or
  3.6.13 if those prior versions are working.  Though many users may
  benefit from the improved performance.
