<h2>1.0 SQLite Shared-Cache Mode</h2>

<p>Starting with version 3.3.0, SQLite includes a special "shared-cache"
mode (disabled by default) intended for use in embedded servers. If
shared-cache mode is enabled and a thread establishes multiple connections
to the same database, the connections share a single data and schema cache.
This can significantly reduce the quantity of memory and IO required by
the system.</p>

<p>In version 3.5.0, shared-cache mode was modified so that the same
cache can be shared across an entire process rather than just within
a single thread.  Prior to this change, there were restrictions on
passing database connections between threads.  Those restrictions were
dropped in 3.5.0 update.  This document describes shared-cache mode
as of version 3.5.0.</p>

<p>Shared-cache mode changes the semantics
of the locking model in some cases. The details are described by
this document. A basic understanding of the normal SQLite locking model (see
<a href="lockingv3.html">File Locking And Concurrency In SQLite Version 3</a>
for details) is assumed.</p>

<h2>2.0 Shared-Cache Locking Model</h2>

<p>Externally, from the point of view of another process or thread, two
or more <a href="c3ref/sqlite3.html">database connections</a> using a shared-cache appear as a single 
connection. The locking protocol used to arbitrate between multiple 
shared-caches or regular database users is described elsewhere.

<p style="font-style:italic;text-align:center">Figure 1</p>

<p>Figure 1 depicts an example runtime configuration where three 
database connections have been established. Connection 1 is a normal
SQLite database connection. Connections 2 and 3 share a cache 
The normal locking
protocol is used to serialize database access between connection 1 and
the shared cache. The internal protocol used to serialize (or not, see
"Read-Uncommitted Isolation Mode" below) access to the shared-cache by
connections 2 and 3 is described in the remainder of this section.
</p>

<p>There are three levels to the shared-cache locking model, 
transaction level locking, table level locking and schema level locking. 
They are described in the following three sub-sections.</p>

<h3>2.1 Transaction Level Locking</h3>

<p>SQLite connections can open two kinds of transactions, read and write
transactions. This is not done explicitly, a transaction is implicitly a
read-transaction until it first writes to a database table, at which point
it becomes a write-transaction.
</p>
<p>At most one connection to a single shared cache may open a 
write transaction at any one time. This may co-exist with any number of read 
transactions. 
</p>

<h3>2.2 Table Level Locking</h3>

<p>When two or more connections use a shared-cache, locks are used to 
serialize concurrent access attempts on a per-table basis. Tables support 
two types of locks, "read-locks" and "write-locks". Locks are granted to
connections - at any one time, each database connection has either a
read-lock, write-lock or no lock on each database table.
</p>

<p>At any one time, a single table may have any number of active read-locks
or a single active write lock. To read data a table, a connection must 
first obtain a read-lock. To write to a table, a connection must obtain a 
write-lock on that table. If a required table lock cannot be obtained,
the query fails and SQLITE_LOCKED is returned to the caller.
</p> 

<p>Once a connection obtains a table lock, it is not released until the
current transaction (read or write) is concluded.
</p>

<h4>2.2.1 Read-Uncommitted Isolation Mode</h4>

<p>The behaviour described above may be modified slightly by using the 
<a href="pragma.html#pragma_read_uncommitted">read_uncommitted</a> pragma to change the isolation level from serialized 
(the default), to read-uncommitted.</p>

<p> A database connection in read-uncommitted mode does not attempt 
to obtain read-locks before reading from database tables as described 
above. This can lead to inconsistent query results if another database
connection modifies a table while it is being read, but it also means that
a read-transaction opened by a connection in read-uncommitted mode can
neither block nor be blocked by any other connection.</p>

<p>Read-uncommitted mode has no effect on the locks required to write to
database tables (i.e. read-uncommitted connections must still obtain 
write-locks and hence database writes may still block or be blocked). 
Also, read-uncommitted mode has no effect on the <i>sqlite_master</i> 
locks required by the rules enumerated below (see section 
"Schema (sqlite_master) Level Locking").
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
  /* Set the value of the read-uncommitted flag:
  **
  **   True  -> Set the connection to read-uncommitted mode.
  **   False -> Set the connectino to serialized (the default) mode.
  */
  PRAGMA read_uncommitted = &lt;boolean&gt;;

  /* Retrieve the current value of the read-uncommitted flag */
  PRAGMA read_uncommitted;
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>2.3 Schema (sqlite_master) Level Locking</h3>

<p>The <i>sqlite_master</i> table supports shared-cache read and write 
locks in the same way as all other database tables (see description 
above). The following special rules also apply:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A connection must obtain a read-lock on <i>sqlite_master</i> before 
accessing any database tables or obtaining any other read or write locks.</li>
<li>Before executing a statement that modifies the database schema (i.e. 
a CREATE or DROP TABLE statement), a connection must obtain a write-lock on 
<i>sqlite_master</i>.
</li>
<li>A connection may not compile an SQL statement if any other connection
is holding a write-lock on the <i>sqlite_master</i> table of any attached
database (including the default database, "main"). 
</li>
</ul>

<h2>3.0 Thread Related Issues</h2>

<p>In SQLite versions 3.3.0 through 3.4.2 when shared-cache mode is enabled, 
a database connection may only be
used by the thread that called <a href="c3ref/open.html">sqlite3_open()</a> to create it.
And a connection could only share cache with another connection in the
same thread.
These restrictions were dropped beginning with SQLite version 3.5.0.
</p>

<h2>4.0 Shared Cache And Virtual Tables</h2>

<p>
In older versions of SQLite,
shared cache mode could not be used together with virtual tables.
This restriction was removed in SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_17.html">version 3.6.17</a>.

<h2>5.0 Enabling Shared-Cache Mode</h2>

<p>Shared-cache mode is enabled on a per-process basis. Using the C 
interface, the following API can be used to enable or disable shared-cache
mode for the calling thread:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
int sqlite3_enable_shared_cache(int);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Each call <a href="c3ref/enable_shared_cache.html">sqlite3_enable_shared_cache()</a> effects subsequent database
connections created using <a href="c3ref/open.html">sqlite3_open()</a>, <a href="c3ref/open.html">sqlite3_open16()</a>, or
<a href="c3ref/open.html">sqlite3_open_v2()</a>.  Database connections that already exist are
uneffected.  Each call to <a href="c3ref/enable_shared_cache.html">sqlite3_enable_shared_cache()</a> overrides
all previous calls within the same process.
</p>

<p>Individual database connections created using <a href="c3ref/open.html">sqlite3_open_v2()</a> can
choose to participate or not participate in shared cache mode by using
the <a href="c3ref/c_open_create.html">SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE</a> or <a href="c3ref/c_open_create.html">SQLITE_OPEN_PRIVATECACHE</a> flags the
third parameter.  The use of either of these flags overrides the
global shared cache mode setting established by <a href="c3ref/enable_shared_cache.html">sqlite3_enable_shared_cache()</a>.
No more than one of the flags should be used; if both SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE
and SQLITE_OPEN_PRIVATECACHE flags are used in the third argument to
<a href="c3ref/open.html">sqlite3_open_v2()</a> then the behavior is undefined.</p>
