CGIC Nonexclusive Commercial License

The party purchasing this license is granted the right
to utilize CGIC, major version 1 or 2, any minor
version thereof, in CGI applications without the
need for a credit notice of any kind. CGI applications
developed by the holder of this license may be
distributed freely in source code or binary form
without additional fees or royalties. This license does 
not grant the right to use CGIC to create a development tool 
which passes on substantially all of the capabilities of the 
CGIC library to the user of the tool, unless that tool is 
to be used internally by the license holder only in order
to develop CGI applications. This license may not
be resold, but applications developed in accordance
with the terms of the license may be distributed
freely subject to the limitations described above.

Future minor (2.x) versions of CGIC will be covered by this
license free of charge. If significant defects of workmanship
are discovered in version 2.x, minor releases to correct them
will be made available before or at the same time that 
those defects are addressed in any future major version. 
Future "major" (3.x) versions will be available to
licensees at an upgrade price of $50.

If, for any reason, any portion of this license is found 
to be invalid, that portion of the license only
is invalidated and the remainder of the agreement
remains in effect.
