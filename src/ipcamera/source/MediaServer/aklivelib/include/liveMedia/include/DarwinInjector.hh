/*
To use a "DarwinInjector":
  1/ Create RTP sinks and RTCP instances for each audio or video subsession.
       Note: These can use 0.0.0.0 for the address, and 0 for the port number,
       of each 'groupsock')
  2/ Call "addStream()" for each.
  3/ Call "setDestination()" to specify the remote Darwin Streaming Server.
     Note: You must have 'write' permission on the Darwin Streaming Server.
       This can be set up using a "qtaccess" file in the server's 'movies'
       directory.  For example, the following "qtaccess" file allows anyone to
       play streams from the server, but allows only valid users to
       inject streams *into* the server:
           <Limit WRITE>
           require valid-user
           </Limit>
           require any-user
     Use the "remoteUserName" and "remotePassword" parameters to
     "setDestination()", as appropriate.
  4/ Call "startPlaying" on each RTP sink (from the corresponding 'source').
