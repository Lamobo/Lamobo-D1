 * provides a thread implementation agnostic interface to Iperf. If 
 * threads are not available (HAVE_THREAD is undefined), thread_start
 * does not start a new thread but just launches the specified object 
 * in the current thread. Everything that defines a thread of 
 * execution in Iperf is contained in an thread_Settings structure. To
 * start a thread simply pass one such structure into thread_start.
